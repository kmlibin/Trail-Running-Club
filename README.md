# Club Website



### The goal of this project was to create a site that was responsive to different screensizes using HTML and CSS, we could use either FlexBox or CSS Grid. Design and what kind of club to create was up to me.

#### I was required to include :

- Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.

- Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.

- Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.

### I learned:

This was my first time using media queries, and it was pretty satisfying to see how easily they changed the page. This was also my first time using CSS Grid, and I definitely learned why it would be beneficial to name the grid areas (I spent way too long fiddling with placing things exactly in columns and rows).
