#Club Website



The goal of this project was to create a site that was responsive to different screensizes using HTML and CSS, we could use either FlexBox or CSS Grid. I incorporated both.

Design and what kind of club to create was up to me. 

I was required to include :

- Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
- Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
- Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.


This was my first time using media queries, and it was pretty satisfying to see how easily they changed the page. This was
also my first time using CSS Grid, and I definitely learned why it would be beneficial to name the grid areas (I spent way too long
fiddling with placing things exactly in columns and rows). 

I was previewing the page in Chrome as I was creating it - I'd made it so the form was beneath the map, in the same box. However I checked it on Safari and the form was way off
to the right for some reason. I just took the form from the box and put it in the footer, but I really don't like how it looks. I imagine I need some kind of webkit to fix?
